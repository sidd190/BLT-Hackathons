## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load hackathon data"

**Possible causes:**
1. Repository names incorrect
2. Repositories are private without token
3. API rate limit exceeded
4. Network error

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for specific error
- Verify repository names (format: `owner/repo`)
- Add GitHub token to increase rate limit
- Wait 1 hour if rate limited

### Issue: Empty Leaderboard

**Possible causes:**
1. No PRs merged during hackathon period
2. Hackathon hasn't started
3. Date range is incorrect

**Solutions:**
- Verify dates are in ISO 8601 format
- Check that hackathon period includes PRs
- Wait for PRs to be merged if ongoing

### Issue: Chart Not Displaying

**Possible causes:**
1. Chart.js not loaded
2. JavaScript error
3. No data to display

**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Chart.js CDN is accessible
- Ensure dates are correctly formatted

### Issue: Images Not Loading

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong file path
2. Files not committed to repo
3. Case sensitivity (GitHub is case-sensitive)

**Solutions:**
- Check image paths in config match actual files
- Ensure images are in `images/` folder
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Dates Showing Incorrectly

**Possible causes:**
1. Wrong date format
2. Timezone confusion

**Solutions:**
- Use ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
- Always use UTC (Z suffix)
- Use an online ISO 8601 converter if needed

## GitHub API Rate Limits

### Without Token
- **60 requests per hour**
- Shared across all unauthenticated requests from your IP

### With Token
- **5000 requests per hour**
- Per token

### Check Your Rate Limit
```javascript
// Add to browser console:
fetch('https://api.github.com/rate_limit', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
    }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

## Performance Testing

### Expected Load Times
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- GitHub API requests: 1-3 seconds per repository
- Chart rendering: < 500ms

### Optimization Tips
1. Use a GitHub token to avoid rate limits
2. Limit number of repositories (recommend < 10)
3. Reduce `maxLeaderboardEntries` if slow
4. Cache is automatic (5 minutes)

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No sensitive data in config
- [ ] GitHub token not committed (if used in production)
- [ ] Using HTTPS for all external resources
- [ ] No mixed content warnings

## Deployment Verification

After deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. **Visit your site:** `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/`

2. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Verify deployment succeeded
   - Check for any errors

3. **Test from different devices:**
   - Desktop computer
   - Mobile phone
   - Tablet

4. **Share test link:**
   - Send to a friend or colleague
   - Verify they can access it
   - Ask for feedback

## Load Testing

For high-traffic hackathons, test with expected load:

1. **Use browser dev tools:**
   - Throttle network speed
   - Simulate slow 3G
   - Check if page still usable

2. **Check multiple simultaneous users:**
   - Open in multiple browsers/devices
   - Refresh simultaneously
   - Monitor for issues
