*/

// =====================
// REPOSITORY FORMAT
// =====================

/*
Repository format is always: "owner/repo-name"

Examples:
- "facebook/react"
- "microsoft/vscode"  
- "OWASP-BLT/BLT"
- "your-organization/your-project"

Make sure repositories are:
1. Public (or your token has access)
2. Active (has pull requests)
3. Correctly spelled

ORGANIZATION TRACKING:
Instead of listing individual repositories, you can track all repositories
in a GitHub organization by using the 'organization' field:

github: {
    token: "",
    organization: "OWASP-BLT"  // Track all repos in this org
}

This is particularly useful for organizations with many repositories
or when repositories are added/removed frequently.
*/

// =====================
// TOKEN SETUP GUIDE
// =====================

/*
To get a GitHub token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it something like "Hackathon Dashboard"
4. Set expiration (recommend: No expiration for long-term hackathons)
5. Select scopes:
   - ✅ public_repo (for public repositories)
   - ✅ repo (if tracking private repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
8. Paste it in the config:
   
   github: {
       token: "ghp_your_token_here_abc123xyz789",
       repositories: [...]
   }

⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:
Never commit tokens to public repositories!
For production, use environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
